##  Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning solution to predict 30-day hospital readmissions for diabetic patients, helping healthcare providers identify high-risk patients and implement targeted interventions.

##  Business Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: Reduce 30-day readmission rates through early risk identification
- **Secondary Goals**: 
  - Optimize resource allocation for high-risk patients
  - Improve patient outcomes through targeted care
  - Reduce healthcare costs associated with preventable readmissions

##  Dataset & Features
- **Total Patients**: 1,000 diabetic patients
- **Features**: 19 predictive variables including:
  - Demographics (age, gender)
  - Clinical metrics (lab procedures, medications, diagnoses)
  - Hospital stay details (length, admission type)
  - Medical history (previous visits, glucose levels, A1C results)

##  Model Performance
### Best Model: Logistic Regression (Balanced)
- **AUC Score**: 0.531
- **Sensitivity (Recall)**: 72% - Successfully identifies 72% of high-risk patients
- **Precision**: 15.3%
- **F1-Score**: 0.252
- **Optimal Threshold**: 43.9%

### Clinical Impact
- **True Positives**: 18 high-risk patients correctly identified
- **False Negatives**: 7 high-risk patients missed (critical metric)
- **Sensitivity**: 72% of readmission cases caught
- **Specificity**: 43% of non-readmission cases correctly identified

##  Business Impact
### Cost-Benefit Analysis (per 200 patients)
- **Potential Savings**: $270,000 from prevented readmissions
- **False Positive Costs**: $50,000 for unnecessary interventions
- **Net Savings**: $220,000
- **Annual Potential**: $4.86M (assuming 18 cycles/year)

##  Risk Stratification System
The model categorizes patients into 5 risk levels:
- **Very Low Risk** (2.5%): <20% probability
- **Low Risk** (30.0%): 20-40% probability
- **Medium Risk** (50.0%): 40-60% probability
- **High Risk** (17.5%): 60-80% probability
- **Very High Risk** (0%): >80% probability

##  Clinical Recommendations

### ðŸ”´ High/Very High Risk Patients (>60% score)
- Intensive discharge planning required
- Follow-up within 48-72 hours
- Consider extended observation
- Home health services evaluation
- Comprehensive medication reconciliation

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk Patients (40-60% score)
- Enhanced discharge planning
- Follow-up within 1 week
- Additional patient education
- Care coordination team involvement

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk Patients (<40% score)
- Standard discharge procedures
- Routine follow-up scheduling
- Standard education materials

## Technical Implementation

### Model Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Categorical encoding using LabelEncoder
   - Feature scaling with StandardScaler
   - Balanced class weights for imbalanced dataset

2. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression with balanced class weights
   - 5-fold cross-validation for stability
   - Threshold optimization using Youden's J statistic

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - ROC-AUC for overall performance
   - Precision/Recall for clinical relevance
   - Confusion matrix for detailed analysis

### Deployment Architecture
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: Interactive web interface for real-time predictions
- **Model Persistence**: Pickle files for model deployment
- **Feature Engineering**: Automated preprocessing pipeline
- **Risk Visualization**: Real-time risk gauge and factor analysis

## Key Features Identified
Top predictive factors (Random Forest importance):
1. Time in hospital
2. Number of lab procedures
3. Number of medications
4. Emergency department visits
5. Previous inpatient admissions
6. A1C test results
7. Glucose serum levels
8. Insulin management
9. Primary diagnosis
10. Number of procedures

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate (2 weeks)
- [ ] Validate model on hospital historical data
- [ ] Create clinical workflow integration plan
- [ ] Train healthcare staff on risk interpretation
- [ ] Deploy Streamlit dashboard for pilot testing

### Phase 2: Short-term (1-3 months)
- [ ] Implement A/B testing with control groups
- [ ] Establish model monitoring protocols
- [ ] Integrate with existing EHR systems
- [ ] Develop automated alerts for high-risk patients

### Phase 3: Long-term (3-6 months)
- [ ] Expand to 60-day and 90-day predictions
- [ ] Develop personalized intervention recommendations
- [ ] Implement continuous learning capabilities
- [ ] Scale to other patient populations

## Limitations & Considerations

### Model Limitations
- **Moderate Predictive Power**: AUC of 0.531 indicates room for improvement
- **High False Positive Rate**: 57% of low-risk patients flagged as high-risk
- **Data Quality Dependency**: Performance relies on accurate, complete data
- **Population Specificity**: Trained on diabetic patients only

### Clinical Considerations
- **Human Oversight Required**: Model should supplement, not replace clinical judgment
- **Regular Monitoring Needed**: Performance may degrade over time
- **Bias Potential**: May reflect historical care patterns and biases
- **Intervention Validation**: Need to measure actual impact of interventions

## Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. **Clinical Integration**: Always combine predictions with clinical assessment
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track model performance and retrain regularly
3. **Staff Training**: Ensure proper interpretation and use of predictions
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear records of model decisions and outcomes
5. **Ethical Guidelines**: Establish protocols for handling model disagreements

## Success Metrics
### Primary KPIs
- Reduction in 30-day readmission rates
- Improvement in patient satisfaction scores
- Decrease in readmission-related costs
- Increased efficiency in discharge planning

### Secondary KPIs
- Model accuracy and stability over time
- Staff adoption and satisfaction rates
- Integration success with existing workflows
- Cost-effectiveness of interventions

## Lessons Learned
1. **Class Imbalance**: Requires careful handling with appropriate techniques
2. **Clinical Context**: Healthcare predictions need careful interpretation
3. **Feature Engineering**: Domain expertise crucial for meaningful features
4. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Clinical staff input essential for success
5. **Iterative Improvement**: Model performance improves with continuous refinement

## Next Steps & Support
